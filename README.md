Recession data taken from: https://fred.stlouisfed.org OECD based Recession Indicators for Canada from the Peak through the Trough, +1 or 0, Daily, Not Seasonally Adjusted

Cleaned data in original two datasets and then merged them together in excel in order to find the relationship between recession data and movies produced per year (used vlookup and pivot tables to achieve this). 

Created visuals in Tableau that helped to answer research questions such as if fewer movies are released in times of recession, if movie budgets shrink in times of recession, if movies generate more income during times of recession, and the movie directors with the highest median gross profit (dual line and area chart, clustered bar chart, area chart).
